*** Tarot decks I admire but haven't gotten around to picking up
- [[http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/ancient-marseilles/][Ancient Tarot of Marseilles]] is a reproduction that inspired the Waite-Smith deck.
- [[https://www.etsy.com/listing/130158408/animalis-os-fortuna-complete-tarot-deck][Animal Os Fortuna]] Another animal deck. All Black & White, this uses a combination of animals and their bones to create feeling of macabre, without blood & gore
- [[http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/book-of-thoth-etteilla/][Book of Thoth Etteilla Tarot]] is a reporduction of the Thoth decks, one of the first attempts at constructing an explicitly occult deck.
- [[http://a.co/d/frUqIod][Cat's Eye Tarot]] Designed by a feline vetrinarian uses classic Waite-Smith suits and lightly interprets the symbols in a feline context
- [[http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/english-magic-tarot/][English Magic Tarot]] has this fantastic, flat imagery that looks simple on the surface but has a dozen stories.
- [[http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/international-icon/][International Icon Tarot]] This is the Waite-Smith tarot, stripped of all detail, attempting to leave only the symbols.
- [[http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/lo-scarabeo/][Lo Scarabeo]] trys to blend the two major lineages of Tarot, The Waite-Smith and The Crowley Thoth.
- [[http://a.co/d/5HJW7JV][Mystical Cats Tarot]] Gorgeous artwork, heavily interpreted Waite-Smith. Rather than putting cats in classic scenes, it instead imagines the feelings of the scenes and puts them in a feline context. Suits are Earth, Sky, Fire, Sea
- [[Thelema Tarot]] has beautiful images that each seem to glow.
- [[http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/visconti-sforza/][Visconti-Sforza Tarot]] is a historical reproduction of one of the earliest known Tarot decks.
- [[http://a.co/d/6Vrf4ZM][The Wild Unknown Tarot]] Pen & ink style artwork, great use of shading.
