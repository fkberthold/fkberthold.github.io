I collect Tarot decks because the art on them is interesting and I enjoy researching where it came from.

*** Tarot decks I admire but haven't gotten around to picking up
+ [[http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/ancient-marseilles/][Ancient Tarot of Marseilles]] is a reproduction that inspired the Waite-Smith deck.
+ [[https://www.etsy.com/listing/130158408/animalis-os-fortuna-complete-tarot-deck][Animal Os Fortuna]] Another animal deck. All Black & White, this uses a combination of animals and their bones to create feeling of macabre, without blood & gore
+ [[http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/book-of-thoth-etteilla/][Book of Thoth Etteilla Tarot]] is a reporduction of the Thoth decks, one of the first attempts at constructing an explicitly occult deck.
+ [[http://a.co/d/frUqIod][Cat's Eye Tarot]] Designed by a feline vetrinarian uses classic Waite-Smith suits and lightly interprets the symbols in a feline context
+ [[http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/english-magic-tarot/][English Magic Tarot]] has this fantastic, flat imagery that looks simple on the surface but has a dozen stories.
+ [[http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/international-icon/][International Icon Tarot]] This is the Waite-Smith tarot, stripped of all detail, attempting to leave only the symbols.
+ [[http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/kingdom-within/][Kingdom Within Tarot]] This tarot leans heavily on the astrological and quabalistic connections for it's art, with only light connections to the Waite-Smith.
+ [[http://a.co/d/5HJW7JV][Mystical Cats Tarot]] Gorgeous artwork, heavily interpreted Waite-Smith. Rather than putting cats in classic scenes, it instead imagines the feelings of the scenes and puts them in a feline context. Suits are Earth, Sky, Fire, Sea
+ [[https://www.amazon.com/Sola-Busca-Tarot-Museum-Quality/dp/0738761168/][The Sola-Busca Tarot]] One of the first Tarot decks to have fully illustrated pip cards. This was likely one of the major inspirations for the Waite-Smith deck.
+ [[http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/sweet-twilight/][The Tarot of Sweet Twilight]] Brilliantly colored with a surreal landscape and striking imagery.
+ [[Thelema Tarot]] has beautiful images that each seem to glow.
+ [[http://a.co/d/6Vrf4ZM][The Wild Unknown Tarot]] Pen & ink style artwork, great use of shading.
