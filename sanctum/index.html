<p>

I've designed a game to be played with a Waite-Smith style Tarot. I've played and enjoyed the game several times now, but the rules are a work in progress. Eventually this will be a full set of easily read rules. For now it's just a set of notes on how we've been playing.

</p>

<p>

The goal of Sanctum is to push your opponent off of their Sanctum.

</p>

<p>

Each player will deal themselves 12 cards, from those 12 cards they will play 6 suited cards that will compose their Sanctum. The remaining 6 will be their starting hand. If they want to play any trump cards as influences they may do so at any time preceding the first attack. If a trump card is played it may be immidiately replenished to bring the hand back up to six cards.

</p>

<p>

There are two kinds of attack, a suited attack and a trump attack.

</p>

<p>

During an suited attack 4 factors determine the strength of the attack:

</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of the attacking card.</li>
<li>If the suit of the attacking card matches(+1) or opposes(-1) the ground element.</li>
<li>If the suit of the attacking card matches(+1) the current influence.</li>
<li>If the suit of the attacking card consumes(+1) the attacking suit of their opponent.</li>
</ul>

<p>

During a trump attack 4 factors determine the strength of the attack:

</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of the ground card.</li>
<li>If the suit generated by the combination of the players influence card(bottom line) and the played card(top line) matches(+1) or opposes(-1) the ground element.</li>
<li>If the generated suit matches(+1) the current influence.</li>
<li>If the generated suit consumes(+1) the attacking suit of their opponent.</li>
</ul>

<p>

When the winner is resolved by which has the highest attack score then the action will be determined by the winner's suit:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire: Pushes the loser away from the winner by one space.</li>
<li>Air: Rotates the loser's position around the center of the board.</li>
<li>Water: Reflects the loser's attack, causing their element to apply as though it was what the winner attacked with.</li>
<li>Earth: Pulls the winner toward the loser by one space.</li>
</ul>

<p>

Special cases:

</p>

<p>

<code> Tie </code> If their is a tie then the play continues. If ground cards would be replaced by those they would have been used by they are. The players select another card from their hands and play those. They <b>do not</b> draw. If both players run out of cards in a tie, then it's considered a tie and they draw as normal and continue.

</p>

<p>

<code> Players Are In the same location </code> If players are both in the same location, then 'pulling' toward and 'pushing' away doesn't make a lot of sense. Instead if a 'pull' succeeds then the player is moved uphill, away from the nearest end of their sanctum. If a 'push' succeeds, then the player is moved downhill, toward the nearest end of their sanctum.

</p>

<p>

Once the attack is resolved, then each player draws enough cards to fill their hand to 7, then discards one hand from their hand.

</p>

<p>

A suited card's value is determined as follows:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Ace: 3 Points</li>
<li>Face Card: 2 Points</li>
<li>2-10 Card: 1 Point</li>
</ul>

<p>

Before attack cards are played, players may play trump cards below their ground cards which will act as influence cards. When a trump card is played in this way it is immidiately replenished from the deck.
